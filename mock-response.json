     "title": "NODE: Programming the NODE irrigation controller",
     "description": "In this video, you will learn how to program the Node battery powered irrigation controller.\nThe Node controller requires the use of DC latching solenoids.  To create a program on the Node sprinkler timer you will need a start time, run time, and day to water. \n\nTo get started, learn about the buttons on the Node sprinkler clock.  To turn the Node display on, hold any button down.  Use the arrow buttons to navigate through the settings, the plus and minus buttons to adjust a given option, and the center button to change the page or advance to the next feature.\n\nTo program the Node battery operated irrigation controller you must first set the date and time. To set the time and date on the node press the center button, simply scroll through the choices using the left and right arrow buttons and adjust the displayed item using the plus and minus buttons.\n\nAn irrigation program is a group of stations that are set to water at the same time.  To create a program on your Node battery operated sprinkler controller press the center button to access the start time programming option. Adjust your start times using the plus and minus buttons on the irrigation controller.  To delete an irrigation start time, use the plus button to find the off position just before midnight and press the center button.\n\nTo assign run times to the stations on your Node battery powered sprinkler clock, use the center button to scroll past the start time screen to the station run time option.  Use the plus button to add minutes to your run time, then use the right arrow scroll to the next station.  Once you have set your station run times for your sprinklers, press the center button to scroll back to the home screen.\n\nTo set the days that you want your sprinkler system to run using your Node battery powered irrigation controller, use the center button to scroll through to the water days option.  Use the right and left arrows to scroll through the dots that signify the days of the week (starting with Monday) and hit plus or minus to select the days to water. Another option is to set your Node controller to use an odd/even watering option, or interval mode to set the number of days between watering cycles.\n\nTo set up a separate program on your Node battery powered sprinkler timer, use the center button to go to the start time option and hit the program button one time. Once in program B, you will assign start times, run times, and watering days for this program. After setting the program, press the center button to return to the home screen.\n\nAnother feature that the Node battery powered irrigation controller has is the seasonal adjustment option. To activate the seasonal adjustment, press the center button to go to the percentage option and adjust using the plus or minus buttons.  Once the desired setting is reached, press the center button to return to the home screen.\n\nTo run your sprinkler stations manually with the Node battery powered irrigation clock, hold down the right arrow to enter into the manual mode.  Select the station you wish to run by using the right arrow.  To turn the station off, use the center button to scroll to the off screen and it will turn off that zone, then use the center button to return to the home screen.\n",
